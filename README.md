# Neural Network in C++ (CNN From Scratch)

This repository contains a purely C++ implementation of a Neural Network (and eventually CNN) built from scratch. The goal is to understand the underlying mathematics and architecture of deep learning models by implementing tensors, autograd, and layers without relying on external machine learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

> **🚧 Status: Under Development**
> This project is currently a work in progress. Features are being added actively. Check [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for detailed feature tracking and updates.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later (e.g., `g++` or `clang`).
- `git` for version control.

### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amish-03/CNN_From_Scratch.git
cd CNN_From_Scratch
```

### Building and Running
The project can be compiled using `g++`.

**To run the main application:**
```bash
g++ main.cpp tensor.cpp -o main.exe
./main.exe
```

**To run the test suite:**
```bash
g++ tests.cpp tensor.cpp -o tests.exe
./tests.exe
```
